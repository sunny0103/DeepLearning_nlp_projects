Reuters news agency reported that Iraq's Oil Ministry has awarded the first post-war oilfield contracts to a Canadian and a Turkish company. By 1700 GMT, Petrel's shares fell from 97p ($1.87) to 44p ($0.85). Petrel said that it has not received any information from Iraqi authorities to confirm or deny the report.  Iraq is seeking to award contracts for three projects, valued at $500m (Â£258.5m). Turkey's Everasia is reported by Reuters to have won a contract to develop the Khurmala Dome field in the north of the country. A Canadian company, named IOG, is reported to have won the contract to run the Himrin field. Ironhorse Oil and Gas has denied to Reuters that it is the company in question. These two projects aim to develop Khurmala field to produce 100,000 barrels per day and raise the output of Himrin. The winners of the contract are to build new flow lines and build gas separation stations. The contract to develop the Suba-Luhais field has not yet been awarded as Iraq's Oil Ministry is studying the offers. If Iraq's cabinet approves the oil ministry's choice of companies, then this will be the first deal that Iraq has signed with a foreign oil company. Iraq is still trying to boost its production capacity to match levels last seen in the eighties, before the war with Iran. Oil officials hope to double Iraq's output by the end of the decade.\n\nU.S. Navy to Award Huge Satellite Contract Soon:WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy will soon announce  whether Lockheed Martin Corp. or Raytheon Co. will build a \\$6.4  billion communications system to beef up satellite services for  U.S. troops, the White House and State Department, a spokesman  said on Tuesday.\n\n\n-----------------------------------1----------------------------\nSpanish coach facing action in race row:MADRID (AFP) - Spanish national team coach Luis Aragones faces a formal investigation after Spain #39;s Football Federation decided to open disciplinary proceedings over racist comments about Thierry Henry of France and Arsenal.\n\nBruce Lee statue for divided city:In Bosnia, where one man #39;s hero is often another man #39;s villain, some citizens have decided to honour one whom Serbs, Croats and Muslims can all look up to - the kung fu great Bruce Lee.\n\nThomson to Back Both Blu-ray and HD-DVD:Company, one of the core backers of Blu-ray, will also support its rival format.\n\n\n-----------------------------------2----------------------------\nOnly Lovers Left Alive's Tilda Swinton Talks About Almost Quitting Acting and Yasmine Hamdan Performs 'Hal' Live In NYC   (HuffPo Exclusive Videos) authors:Yasmine Hamdan performs 'Hal' which she also sings in the film during a scene when two world-weary vampires begin to heal and find a way to continue living as they remember the power and mystery of creation itself.\n\nQualcomm plans to phone it in on cellular repairs:Over-the-air fixes for cell phones comes to Qualcomm's CDMA.\n\nIt's Not As Easy As You Think To Spot A Gerrymandered Map authors:Our electoral districts have really weird shapes.

The full-back will have surgery on Monday after fracturing his thumb in the 24-18 win over France on Saturday. But Welsh legend Phil Bennett insisted Wales can cope without Thomas as they chase a first Grand Slam in 27 years. Bennett told BBC Sport: \"Such is the spirit in the camp, they'll put Kevin Morgan at 15, Rhys Williams at wing and just carry on.\" Thomas will miss the match against Scotland on 13 March, and what promises to be a huge encounter against the Irish six days later. Bennett added: \"It's a setback. He's a great captain, he leads from the front and the boys love him.\" Thomas was replaced at half-time by Williams as his side turned around a 15-6 deficit in Paris.  \"With Gareth missing I would think Michael Owen will be our captain,\" said Wales coach Mike Ruddock. \"He did a great job in the second half in France. He has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship.\" Wales travel to Edinburgh to take on Scotland in a fortnight and then host Ireland in Cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the Grand Slam and championship decider. Bennett, an inspirational fly-half for Llanelli and Wales in the 1970s, insisted the national team were entering a new golden period. \"It was a great game and a magnificent result for Wales,\" Bennett told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.  \"The way this young team are blending, the glory days are on their way back. \"We couldn't get possession early on and France dominated and scored two tries. \"Had they been ruthless, Wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down. But they didn't take their chances. \"Wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides. \"The All Blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half. But the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.\"\n\nT in the Park sells out in days:Tickets for Scotland's biggest music festival have sold out in record time, five months before the event is held.  The 12th annual T in the Park festival, which takes place at Balado near Kinross in July, sold out just four days after the line-up was announced. Green Day, the Foo Fighters and Keane are among the acts that had already been lined up to appear at the event. However, the organisers have revealed Scots favourites Travis as well as soulman James Brown will also appear.  Last year tickets sold out 10 weeks before the festival but organisers confirmed that all 130,000 for the two-day event had been sold. Geoff Ellis, CEO of festival organisers Big Day Out Ltd, said this year's event promises to be the best yet. \"After last year's sell-out, we did think this year's event would sell slightly earlier, however this is way beyond our expectations,\" Mr Ellis said.  \"We are extremely proud that fans are so excited about T in the Park that they have made absolutely sure that their place at Balado is booked for 2005, and we will deliver one of the greatest events yet for them in July.\" More than 120 acts will play on eight stages over the weekend of 9 and 10 July. Brit Award winners Keane and The Streets are among the main attractions, while The Killers and dance act The Prodigy are also on the bill. Both Green Day and The Foo Fighters last played at the festival in 2002, the same year Oasis and Basement Jaxx were among the headline acts.\n\nHodges announces rugby retirement:Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States.  The 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli's player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. \"Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early,\" said Hodges.  \"It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation.\" The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.  Scarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. \"We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won't all be re-signed, it's a chance to invigorate the squad,\" he said. \"I'm positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field.\" Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. \"David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,\" said Gallacher. \"He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. \"I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well.\" Hodges described his years at Stradey as \"the best time of my life.\"\n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# '''\n# 0: business\n# 1: Entertainment\n# 2: politics\n# 3:sports\n# 4:tech\n# 5: world\n# '''\n\nmapping_dict = {\n    0: 0,\n    1: 5,\n    2: 4,\n    3: 2,\n    4: 1,\n    5: 3\n}\n\ndata['doc2vec_mapping'] = data['doc2vec_predict'].apply(lambda x: mapping_dict[x])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-24T11:21:33.076943Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-24T11:21:33.077596Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-24T11:21:33.124255Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-24T11:21:33.077561Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-24T11:21:33.123340Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"check_predict('tfidf')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-24T11:21:35.878448Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-24T11:21:35.878814Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-24T11:21:35.941895Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-24T11:21:35.878785Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-24T11:21:35.940772Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"==================tfidf==================\n-----------------------------------0----------------------------\nThree Palestinians killed in Rafah; Palestinians blast one Israeli &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;:Three Palestinians were killed and other three injured one of them in a critical health condition by the fire of the Israeli occupation forces in al-Salam quarters to the south of Rafah near the border strip with Egypt.\n\nValiant &lt;em&gt;Reg&lt;/em&gt; readers save internet:&lt;strong&gt;Letters&lt;/strong&gt; Reports of demise premature\n\nRigel, Merck Form Development Partnership:NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biotechnology company Rigel  Pharmaceuticals Inc. &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=RIGL.O target=/stocks/quickinfo/fullquote\"&gt;RIGL.O&lt;/A&gt; has entered into a collaboration  pact with drugmaker Merck   Co.
